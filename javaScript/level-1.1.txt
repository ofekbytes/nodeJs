-- scope - JavaScript has two scopes â€“ global and local. 
--- global scope - 
    Any variable declared outside of a function belongs to the global scope, 
    and is therefore accessible from anywhere in your code. 
--- local scope - 
    Each function has its own scope, and any variable declared within that function 
    is only accessible from that function and any nested functions.

--- example: local/global scope

//global scope
var fName = 'Jron';
var age = 45;
var haveBusTicket = true;

// function call with paraments
console.log(fnPrintUserInformation(fName, age, haveBusTicket));

// function with argument> and return value
function fnPrintUserInformation(name, age, busTicket) {
    //local scope
    return "Name is " + name + ", Age is " + age + ", busTickets" + busTicket;
}

-- var is a keyword that create a variable (outdate syntax)
-- let is a keyword that create a variable (scope of the "let" is defferent fron "var" variable)
-- const is a keyword that create a variable that assigned once at declaration time 
   and never changed (can't be assigned again)
